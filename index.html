<center>
<h2><u>Example Problem</u></h2>

<h3>Let's say that B was equal to 43 inches and C was equal to 78 inches. What is the area of the triangle.</h3>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>To find the area of this triangle. You have to do 1/2 times Width Times Height. So you have to multiply the height and the Width and then divide the answer by 2.
So I did 43 X 78 and got 3354 inches. Then I divided that by 1/2 and got 1677 inches. So now you know that the area is 1677 inches SQUARED</h4>

<h2><u>Example Problem</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">3/4 X 8/9</h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>To find the solution to multiplying fractions, you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator,
so for the numerator I did 3 X 8 and got 24. Then I did 4 X 9 and got 36. The numerator is 24 and the denominator is 36.
The fraction is 24/36. Which you can simplify to get 2/3.
<h2><u>Example Problem 2</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">6/7 X 9/12</h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>We would use the same way that we used in the last problem. Multiply both numerators
and then multiply both denominators. So you do 6 X 9 and get 54. Then you do 7 X 12 and you get 84. 
So the fraction is 54/84</h4>
<h2><u>Now you try</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">9/45 X 4/7</h1>
