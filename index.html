<h1 class="the_cow_goes_woof"><u>How to find the area of a triangle</u></h1>
<center>
<h2><u>Example Problem</u></h2>

<h3>Let's say that B was equal to 43 inches and C was equal to 78 inches. What is the area of the triangle.</h3>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>To find the area of this triangle. You have to do 1/2 times Width Times Height. So you have to multiply the height and the Width and then divide the answer by 2.
So I did 43 X 78 and got 3354 inches. Then I divided that by 1/2 and got 1677 inches. So now you know that the area is 1677 inches SQUARED</h4>
<h1 class="the_cow_goes_woof"><u>Multiplying Fractions</u></h1>
<center>
<h2><u>Example Problem</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">3/4 X 8/9</h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>To find the solution to multiplying fractions, you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator,
so for the numerator I did 3 X 8 and got 24. Then I did 4 X 9 and got 36. The numerator is 24 and the denominator is 36.
The fraction is 24/36. Which you can simplify to get 2/3.
<h2><u>Example Problem 2</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">6/7 X 9/12</h1>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>We would use the same way that we used in the last problem. Multiply both numerators
and then multiply both denominators. So you do 6 X 9 and get 54. Then you do 7 X 12 and you get 84. 
So the fraction is 54/84</h4>
<h2><u>Now you try</u></h2>
<h1 class="fraction">9/45 X 4/7</h1>
<h1 class="the_cow_goes_woof"><u>Dividing Fractions By Whole numbers.</u></h1>
<h2><u>Example Problem</u>/h2>
<h2 class="fraction">3/4 divided by 7</h2>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>For this type of problem. We use the KCF method. KCF stands for Keep Change Flip.
You keep the fraction the way it is. Then you change the whole number by putting it over one.
So it is still the same number, just in fraction form. So in this case it is 7/1.
So now we have 3/4 divided by 7/1. Then we flip the fraction that used to be a whole number.
So now we have 1/7. But now instead of dividing you would multiply. So 3/4 * 1/7. So now 
you would get 3/28</h3>
<h1 class="the_cow_goes_woof">Finding Common Denominators In Fractions</h1>
<h2><u>Example Problem</u>/h2>
<h2 class="fraction">What is the common denominator between 3/4 and 5/6</h2>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>For this problem, we would have to find the least common multiple between the two denominators.
The two denominators are 4 and 6. So we could make lists of the multiples of 4 and 6. For 4 it is 4,8,12,16 etc. For 6 it is 6,12, and 
here! We do not have to do more because we see the same
number on both lists, this number is 12. So the common denominator is 12. If we wanted to find a fraction equevilrnt to 3/4, we know that 4 * 3 is 12, so we have to multiply the numberator by 3 too
so we do 3 * 3 to get 9. So 3/4 is equal to 9/12!</h3>
<h2><u>Now you try</u></h2>
<h2 class="fraction">What is the common denominator between 6/7 and 5/9</h2>
