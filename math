<h3>Let's say that B was equal to 43 inches and C was equal to 78 inches. What is the area of the triangle.</h3>
<h2><u>Solution</u></h2>
<h4>To find the area of this triangle. You have to do 1/2 times Width Times Height. So you have to multiply the height and the Width and then divide the answer by 2.
So I did 43 X 78 and got 3354 inches. Then I divided that by 1/2 and got 1677 inches. So now you know that the area is 1677 inches SQUARED</h4>
